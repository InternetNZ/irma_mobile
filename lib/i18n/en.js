    about2: 'Your attributes will be stored exclusively in the ATTR app on your phone. However, in order to operate the ATTR platform, Internet NZ processes a limited amount of personal data, as explained in its privacy policy (todo link to privacy policy). By starting the registration process of the ATTR app you agree to this processing.',

Whatever you sign with your ATTR app is your own personal responsibility. By using the ATTR app you agree that Internet NZ is no party in whatever agreement you enter into via an ATTR signature. In particular, Internet NZ is not responsible or liable.',
